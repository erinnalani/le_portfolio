This repository contains files and scripts that are a recreation of scripts I wrote and processes I used during data collection projects at work. 

***To test out the Python scripts:
1. Download the Zhongguo_Study_Files and Hanguk_Study_Files to your machine - these contain the spreadsheet and data folders you will need to run the scripts
2. Run generate_upload_csvs_portfolio.py to create the CSV(s) you'll need for the 2nd script - CSV will appear in Downloads
4. Change the Paths in the CSV to match the paths of the data folders in Zhongguo_Study_Files/Zhongguo_Study and/or Hanguk_Study_Files/Hanguk_Study (depending on which study you're running the script for)
5. Run session_metadata_portfolio.py to add session metadata to each data folder - you should see session.json appear in each folder with the added information from the script
